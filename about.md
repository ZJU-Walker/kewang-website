## Bio
I am a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and a Research Assistant at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), expected to graduate in June 2026. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

My research interests lie at the intersection of Robot Learning, VLA, Dexterous Manipulation and Drone Navigation. I am particularly interested in leveraging egocentric human data for dexterous manipulation and developing reliable and efficient robot autonomy systems. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

I am advised by Prof. Chelsea Finn and Prof. Mac Schwager at Stanford. Previously, I was advised by Prof. Junhui Zhang at Zhejiang University. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
