## GRaD-Nav-Onboard: Vision-based Drone Navigation via Differentiable Radiance Fields in Dynamic Environments
Stanford University (Advisor: Prof. Mac Schwager) | Apr 2025 - Present :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- Established an onboard vision-based navigation system that leverages physics-informed motion prediction and dynamic Gaussian Splatting simulation to achieve zero-shot policy transfer in dynamic environments. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

## Safety Critical Control of Quadruped Robots
UC Berkeley (Advisor: Prof. Koushil Sreenath) | May 2023 - Sep 2023 :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- Enabled safe and efficient quadruped locomotion in confined spaces by integrating Control Barrier Functions (CBF) with Model Predictive Control (MPC) and deploying the framework on Unitree GO1 hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
