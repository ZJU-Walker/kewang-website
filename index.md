# Ke Wang

I am a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and a Research Assistant at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), expected to graduate in June 2026. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

My research interests lie at the intersection of Robot Learning, VLA, Dexterous Manipulation and Drone Navigation. I am particularly interested in leveraging egocentric human data for dexterous manipulation and developing reliable and efficient robot autonomy systems. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chelsea Finn (Stanford IRIS Lab) and Prof. Mac Schwager (MSL). Previously, I was advised by Prof. Junhui Zhang at Zhejiang University. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
